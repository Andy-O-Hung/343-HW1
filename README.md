# 343-HW1
Github assignment for 343
Some commands that I think that I will be using quite often is first the git init to create the repository. Git status to check if I have any files that needs to be added to the stage by using git add "file", or git add "*.extension". Once done, we need to commit. In this commit step, we write somethign descriptive to remind us what we did, and a snapshot of the file changes. We can use git log to see all of the changes thanks to the commit command. If not done so, we need to connect to the online repository using git remote add origin "site of repository" so that we could send our local repository Github version. Once all of that is done, we use git push -u origin master only once if this is our first push, else we can just use git push. If we are working with others git pull will be used so that our local repo. is consistent with what everyone is working on. We can see the differences between our local repo and the Github version by using Github diff HEAD as HEAD as the lastest commit. Git diff can also be used in our staging phase, git diff --staged. If we staged something and actually dont want to stage that item, we can just use git reset "file".
